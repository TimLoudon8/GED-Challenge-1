Controls are WASD for movement
'I' key toggles inverted controls

The goal is to destroy all the "good" boxes by running into them and ignoring the "bad" boxes which damage the player.

Objects are spawned using a factory through the use of observers.  Imgur link to UML chart: https://imgur.com/a/jwo9qCd

The singleton calculates the player's Health and updates when they hit a bad object

Note: there is a folder called "GED Challenge 1" and "GEDChallenge1Exe", these folders both have the executable file but are duplicated because I thought there was a problem when uploading using GitBash but there wasn't and I don't know hot to delete folders from Github.
